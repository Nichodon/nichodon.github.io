UNFINISHED!!: This article is about a concept I came up with for graphing functions in a new way. Graphing functions is cool, especially when asymptotes are involved. The problem with graphing is that functions are put on an graph of infinite size. Most functions go on forever to infinity. This means it's impossible to see the entirety of the graph, no matter how far out you zoom.
