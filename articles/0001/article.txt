First, we define our constants. These are 1. the image's height and width, 2. the bounds on the real axis, 3. the bounds on the imaginary axis, 4. the number of iterations to execute, and 5. the "escape radius," or the magnitude of the complex number where it is treated as if it will go to infinity. For taking a picture of the Mandelbrot set, the following settings are suitable, but you may want to adjust them for greater accuracy.
