          notation: though you don't have to be able to read it quickly!</p>

        
<p>Unfortunately, I am not good at explaining the basic ideas of programming to people. This document is written on the assumption that you have had significant experience programming in another language, preferably
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_zQvQ82F4Id" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A programming paradigm including the concept of objects, which have data and functions that can be applied to them. This is often in the form of &quot;classes.&quot;&#10;">object-oriented</a>
          (OO) and imperative: either a primarily scripting language like

          or

          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_L1oL1kF0JB" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A popular general-purpose, compiled to bytecode, object-oriented and imperative programming language, invented by James Gosling in 1994.&#10;">Java</a>
          or
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_6qSAVsl6GX" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A popular general-purpose, compiled to bytecode, object-oriented and imperative programming language, invented by Microsoft in 2000.&#10;">C#</a>. Though syntax and differences to other languages will be explained to the best of my ability, things like for-loops, while loops, functions, etc. which are ubiquitous in almost all such programming languages will not be explained
          beyond features and characteristics specific to C++.</p>

        
<p>When discussing first languages with people who haven&#8217;t programmed before, I typically recommend a language like Python or Ruby: high-level languages that are not so &#8220;close to the metal,&#8221; but close to the way us humans think. With a little
          explanation, even a non-programmer can, perhaps with some difficulty, read basic Python code. I find that C++, on the other hand, is one of those languages whose syntax takes more getting used to.</p>

        
<p>Experience solely in languages that are not imperative &#8211; like Scheme, which seems to be the most popular language in high-school and
          <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/115252/why-is-scheme-my-first-language-in-university" target="_blank">university</a>
          classes &#8211; most likely will not be helpful. I&#8217;m known to have quite the bias against Scheme in particular, so don&#8217;t take my complaints about it seriously, but functional programming requires such a different thinking paradigm than imperative
          programming that you might find some very standard implementation in imperative languages unnatural. This is not to degrade the importance and deep mathematical beauty of functional programming, but to point out that it is very different.</p>

        
<p>If, before starting off on learning C++, you believe that all you need to learn is the syntax, I suggest you wait. A language may have certain syntax or "looks," but syntax is only a part of what makes a language useful, elegant, or appropriate
          for a task. Programming in C++ is very different from programming in other object-oriented languages like Java, or even deeply related languages like
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_mqmTpSrZAD" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A popular general-purpose, compiled and imperative programming language, invented by Dennis Ritchie in 1969.&#10;">C</a>. A language comes shipped not just with a different appearance, but with different conventions, structure, and thinking paradigm.</p>

        
<p>As to more specific requirements, I expect you to know how to navigate folders using the
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_wqt9ovySsg" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="An interface allowing the user to run commands on the computer, provided by the operating system.&#10;">command line</a>
          on your system (i.e. knowing
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_vSjtHLIRtZ" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A command in the command line which allows you to navigate folders.&#10;">cd</a>), as well as understand
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_sAPOlk4p3C" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A number system in base 2, i.e. each digit is either 1 or 0.&#10;">binary</a>

<h2 id='c' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">0.1: Do You Need This?</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>
          <b>tl; dr</b>: If you're already comfortable with all commonly-used features of C++, this is not for you, though you may find some parts of it entertaining.</p>

        
<p>I&#8217;m not a professional developer by any means, just another nerdy teenager interested in programming and how computers work. I&#8217;m not trained as a teacher, either.</p>

        
<p>So why am I writing this, you might ask? There is no lack of quality textbooks for C++, after all. Well, looking at online tutorials for C++, I find a few issues that really impede an interested programmer from learning the language for use. The
          vast majority of online tutorials teach C++ as either

          <ol type="1">
            <li>A small, perhaps even only syntactic extension of C</li>
            <li>A purely object-oriented language like Java, where almost every concept is represented as an object</li>
          </ol>

        </p>

        
<p>I think the problem with teaching these two ways of thought is not that their style is necessarily factually incorrect, per se, but that they are not taking full advantage of C++. As far as languages go, C++ is enormously complex and powerful, but
          with that complexity and power comes the power to mess up in unobvious ways. This, combined with the fact that most of these tutorials attempt to teach from the most basic grounds of programming up, makes fully teaching the language difficult. Once
          you have learned it, however, you can see the beauties of its design.</p>

        
<p>I don&#8217;t know and do not profess to know all of C++&#8217;s features; this takes many years of learning and usage. I do profess, however, the understanding of how it works and how to write mediocre-quality code in it. I write this now rather than later
          because this gives me a unique perspective on the language: unlike a newbie, I&#8217;m not completely clueless, but unlike a seasoned developer, I do not explain concepts to a beginner in a way that takes an unnecessarily high-level view of a subject.
          Unfortunately, this means that this document will not be comprehensive in covering every feature of the language.</p>

        
<p>If you already are an experienced C++ programmer comfortable with types and templates and
          <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_OTHyKXZ432">throw</span>
          and such things, this is not for you. In fact, you&#8217;re probably already a better programmer than I am.</p>

      
</div>

<h2 id='d' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">0.2: Are You Interested?</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>
          <b>tl; dr</b>: C++ was designed more for high-performance situations and large codebases, not for quick and dirty scripts. If you are interested in writing highly performant programs, you might enjoy learning C++.</p>

        
<p>Assuming you didn&#8217;t skip here, the fact that you read this far seems to me that you might be interested. C++ is an amazingly powerful language, an elegant combination of both low-level performance and high-level abstraction, but it takes a while
          to get used to.</p>

        
<p>It is no secret that developing good code in C++ can
          <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.113.1831&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=6" target="_blank">take more time</a>
          than developing in other languages, especially scripting languages. This is because there is a lot less fluff separating you, the programmer, from the machine, your computer&#8217;s processor(s). Consequently, C++ particularly excels in situations where
          you</p>

        
<ol type="a">
          <li>want to maximize performance</li>
          <li>are working with small amounts of processing power and/or
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_EdVzMTQyE8" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="Random Access Memory; memory that can be rapidly accessed at will, unlike a hard drive or SSD&#10;">RAM</a>
          </li>
          <li>work with large amounts of data</li>
        </ol>

        
<p>among others. If you&#8217;re just writing quick and dirty scripts to process text or something, then C++ probably isn&#8217;t for you; some people just find C++ too complex a language for their little code snippets. In large codebases or programs that need
          good performance, however, C++ can work wonders.</p>

        
<p>If C++ is too complicated for you to grasp now and you&#8217;d like to try a language with similar performance benefits, you can try C, which is by and large a subset of C++, or try newer OO languages inspired by C++ like
          <a href="https://dlang.org/" target="_blank">D</a>
          (such a creative name) or
          <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. C, of course, is extremely popular, but not always as scalable as C++. I know nothing about D, but it doesn&#8217;t seem that popular, probably for reasons of C++'s historicity. Though I've
          personally never really looked into it (and I probably should), from what I've seen Rust seems quite a wonderful language with performance benefits comparable to C++. It is relatively new and not yet that mature, but perhaps in the future we&#8217;ll see
          entire operating systems being written in Rust!</p>

        
<p>If you&#8217;re still excited to learn C++, let&#8217;s dive in!</p>
      
</div>
<h1 id='e' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1: Introduction</h1>
<div class="content"><p>Here I seek to explain a few things about C++, where and why it is useful, and provide a brief writing about its history.</p></div><h2 id='f' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.0: What is C++?</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>According to its titular Wikipedia page, C++ is a general-purpose, strongly typed, compiled, object-oriented, imperative, and generic programming language. Let&#8217;s break these adjectives down one by one.</p>

        
<ol type="a">
          <li>
            <b>General-purpose</b>: C++ is meant for a wide variety of uses. You&#8217;ll see C++ code being used in a variety of places, from spaceships to video games to common desktop applications.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Strongly typed</b>: Unlike Python and JS, but like Java, C and C#, every variable has a
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_EwqY5JEzjI" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="Information representing what kind of data a variable represents.&#10;">type</a>. This type is set and cannot be later changed.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiled</b>: A computer is not that smart; it&#8217;s just extremely fast. C++ code, which a programmer can read (<a href="http://ioccc.org/" target="_blank">hopefully</a>
            :P), is translated by a compiler into
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_HWHEiWUukm" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="The binary instructions run directly by a processor.&#10;">machine code</a>. This contrasts with a language like Python, Java or C# in which the code is, to some degree, interpreted: where another native-level program reads the code, figures out what to do, and then executes it on the processor.
            Because of this intermediate step, well-written C++ code is inherently faster than the equivalent
            <i>interpreted</i>
            Python and Java code, with few exceptions. I know Java can be compiled as well, so please don't hate on me for saying this.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Object-Oriented</b>: C++ features classes, user-defined objects that can be used and manipulated in definable ways. As such, code to solve a problem is written using these objects.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Imperative</b>: C++&#8217;s structure is based on statements that are compiled and executed in the sequence specified in the program. It is not a functional language, but it does contain some features similar to and inspired from those of functional languages.</li>
          <li>
            <b>Generic</b>: Probably the most difficult to describe to someone who hasn&#8217;t programmed using generics, but the concept of generic programming is code you write is, to some degree, "agnostic" about types. In other words, the code you write can be
            used for any number of types; in any given instance you just have to tell it which one to use.</li>
        </ol>

        
<p>C++ is only a
          <a href="https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard" target="_blank">language definition</a>
          and there exist a number of compilers working on various systems. C++ compilers exist for Windows, macOS, all flavors of Linux, OpenBSD, et cetera.</p>
      
</div>

<h2 id='g' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.1: Why C++?</h2>
<div class="content"><p>C++ is personally my favorite language, simply because of its power and ease of use for performance-critical applications. Since I do a lot of numerically intensive computing, this is often relevant. As I talked about in the
        </p></div><h3 id='h' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.1.0: Why not C?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>C is a wonderful language, and there are some systems where it is definitely better to use than C++. Even though C++ is not inherently slower than C like
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_TfBsUDvBJ3" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A program execution system where an interpreter serves as a relay between the code itself and the processor's instructions.&#10;">interpreted</a>
            languages are, keeping C++&#8217;s speed at par with C in practice necessitates restricting some of C++&#8217;s language features: not all, but some. These features are those that cannot be implemented by the compiler without some significant overhead. As such,
            C is often the language of choice for small systems.</p>

          
<p>C&#8217;s concepts, however, are almost completely low-level. This is not a bad thing, but can make programming higher-level libraries more difficult. C++ has the low-level capabilities of C, but combines it with higher-level ideas, such as classes and
            templates and so forth. While this may have some (usually small) overhead, expressing yourself in C++, especially when solving a complex problem or writing in large codebases, is usually easier than expressing yourself in C. Furthermore, it&#8217;s harder
            to mess up something critical in C++, because
            <a alias="compiler" arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_iuF0YzX9HF" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A software that converts code in a high level language, like C++, to low level code that can be run by the computer directly.&#10;">compilers</a>
            can do stricter compile-time checking and warn you of possible errors.
          </p>

        
</div>

<h3 id='i' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.1.1: Why not Java?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Java is also a wonderful language. It certainly separates you more from the machine than C++ does, which can be good or bad. It is also significantly more portable than C and C++ across operating systems (though C++11&#8217;s std::thread and C++17&#8217;s
            std::filesystem seeks to change some of that). Most people find that developing in Java is faster, safer, and easier than in C++. There is a reason, after all, that it is the most popular language for development.</p>

          
<p>Using Java has some performance costs, though. The usage of the
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_Aj2tAw3f1l" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="An environment where Java code is run.&#10;">Java Virtual Machine</a>
            (JVM), which adds an intermediate layer, means that there is an inherent performance loss. Memory usage is also much higher than equivalent native-level programs. Accessing memory can be slow, and there is no concept of
            <a alias="pointer" arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_rwLCQISBlw" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A variable storing the position of another variable in memory.&#10;">pointers</a>
            like in C or C++, making certain algorithms much slower than their C/C++ counterparts. If you need to write code with native speed to be used in Java programs, you need to use interfaces like the Java Native Interface (JNI). I was attempting to use
            this, in fact, for our robotics team, but found it incredibly difficult to use. Furthermore, simply using the JNI incurs performance issues during transfer of control between JVM and JNI. Java is also quite verbose compared to most other languages.
            Personally, I wish they would add operator overloading to the language, but perhaps that is a silly idea.</p>

          
<p>Also, unlike many other languages, the Java language is inherently tied to a corporation: formerly Sun Microsystems, now Oracle. While I promise not to go berserk with "free software! free software!", this does mean that the language and reference
            implementation (i.e.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotSpot" target="_blank">HotSpot</a>, which is in C++ by the way :P) is written by a company. Thankfully, through a community process and different licensing, many of these issues have been remedied. Unfortunately, Oracle's famous
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc." target="_blank">lawsuit</a>
            against Google seems to go against this premise.</p>

          
<p>Unfortunately, I have quite a bitter relationship with Java, probably from various bad experiences involving it but not because of a fault of the language itself, so take my words about it with a handful or two of salt.</p>

<h3 id='j' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.1.2: Why not Python?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Python is probably my second favorite language after C++. It is excellent for short scripts, but also great for larger projects that need to be developed quickly. Python also provides lovely object-oriented features -- and operator overloading! It
            is incredibly versatile, and contains a staggering number of built-in standard libraries which do everything from request website data to compression. Plus, it links with native-level code incredibly well.</p>

          
<p>Python, unfortunately, compared to Java and C/C++, is quite slow. It is fine for many uses, but when building performance-critical applications, it is probably not your best choice. If you&#8217;re interested in speeding up your Python code without any
            extra work, however, check out

<h3 id='k' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.1.3: Why not C++?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Every language has problems, and C++ is no exception. It is one of the most complex languages still in common use, which means that messy style is quite common. In practice, restrictions are often placed on what features of C++ are to be used
            among a group of developers, in the form of a style guide, so their code is more maintainable. After all, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

          
<p>C++ is not easy to learn, and even experienced developers will occasionally have issues, especially regarding the Standard Template Library (STL).
            <a href="stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, however, exists for a reason!</p>

          
<p>If you&#8217;re attempting to find an error in a larger program, you might have a hard time if it&#8217;s not found at compile-time. In the worst case scenario you just get a
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_5gqiT6Iqao" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="An error occurring when a program attempts to access an invalid or disallowed portion of memory.&#10;">segmentation fault</a>
            or some other, more obscure error, and have no clue where it came from. Thankfully, tools like
            <a href="http://valgrind.org/" target="_blank">Valgrind</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_blank">gdb</a>
            exist to help you.</p>

          
<p>I hope these problems don&#8217;t discourage you, however, on your C++ journey!</p>
        
</div>

<h2 id='l' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.2: Where is C++?</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>C++ code is found in many places. Large and important libraries which require fast performance, such as
          <a href="https://github.com/opencv/opencv" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, often use C++. The
          <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>
          blockchain system is implemented in C++, as well as
          <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge</a>. NASA
          <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20080039927" target="_blank">uses C++</a>
          for many of their spacecraft. As you can see, it is used in places where performance and reliability are imperative.</p>

        
<p>Some people seem to think C++ is a dying language, or that it is obsolete. Perhaps it's because it's quite old, so it's not considered that "cool" to know it anymore. It's true that nowadays computers are much faster, and often a quickly whipped
          up Python program will work for a certain task which 10 years ago would require a lot more optimization. But the computer power growth rates
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#Near-term_limits" target="_blank">are slowing</a>, and programmers must take advantage of the growth of the number of cores in a processor. Python, unfortunately, suffers from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock" target="_blank">Global Interpreter Lock</a>
          (GIL) which makes
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_b2WIwUChuA" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A programming technique taking advantage of computations happening on the computer simultaneously for improved speed.&#10;">multithreading</a>
          much more difficult. Threading used to be a similarly sore spot for C++, as it had no built-in thread concept like Java does, but C++11 brought with it std::thread, a standardized threading system portable across all supported computers. There also
          exist portable frameworks like
          <a href="http://www.openmp.org/" target="_blank">OpenMP</a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/" target="_blank">OpenCL</a>
          that allow C or C++ programmers to take advantage of multiple cores and/or multiple

Java interfaces to these frameworks are currently lacking in performance.</p>

        
<p>In terms of popularity (which I personally think is a poor index), C++ is consistently
          <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">surveyed</a>
          to be in the top ten most popular languages among developers.</p>

      
</div>

<h2 id='m' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">1.3: How was C++ invented?</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>C++ was invented by Danish computer scientist and programmer
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup" target="_blank">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>
          in 1979. He applied the concept of classes, inspired by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula" target="_blank">Simula</a>, to the already extant C. Throughout the years, C++ developed as a language and was eventually standardized by
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_Uj6ryKCWY0" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="International Organization for Standardization, an organization which (among many other things) standardizes the C++ language.&#10;">ISO</a>
          in 1998. A committee of representatives from various companies in the programming industry, as well as some independent members, continually work on the language definition, expanding it and taking suggestions from the public. Every five years or so
          ISO ratifies a new standard. After the initial standardization, there have been four official standards: C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17. All of these add new features from the language, some much more significant than others. Small errors or
          mis-features are occasionally removed, but conservatively so as to maintain backwards-compatibility. Given this committee process, C++ is not owned in whole or in part by any company or person.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Before you start learning C++, you need to have an environment. For this tutorial you&#8217;ll need to have a C++

The most reputable C++ compilers are probably
          <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/" target="_blank">Clang</a>,
          <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html" target="_blank">GCC</a>, and the
          <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers" target="_blank">Intel compiler</a>. A text editor that&#8217;s not Notepad or TextEdit or whatever is quite important; syntax highlighting is strongly recommended. For free text editors, you can try

<p>For this tutorial, I also suggest you install GNU Make.</p>

        
<p>As stated in Are You Ready?, you will need a basic understanding of the command line on your computer. This is Terminal on macOS, and Command Prompt on Windows. I suggest you learn the
          <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_v2KZyA9rcv" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A command in the command line which allows you to navigate folders.&#10;">cd</a>

<p>XCode command-line tools come with the Clang compiler, as well as GNU Make. In Terminal, enter in the following command:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_SeDL61xtLG" lang="none">xcode-select --install</div>

          
<p>This will install XCode's tools. You may have already done this, considering it also contains important development tools such as Git, Subversion, etc. To test out your Clang installation, try running the command
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_gl7PWHWCf5">g++ -v</span>
            in Terminal. It should print out something along the lines of:</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Unfortunately, it is somewhat of a hassle to install a C++ compiler on Windows. For GCC, you need to install a GNU development interface to Windows like MinGW.

            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_8HyHWexWHc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
            tells the C++ compiler that we want the source code of the file "iostream" to be inserted here. The preprocessor sees this instruction, called a preprocessing directive, and just replaces it with the contents of "iostream." Note that we call this
            preprocessing because all this happens before the code is actually examined for errors and syntax and such.</p>

          
<p>Where is this magical iostream file coming from? Well, iostream is part of the C++ Standard Library, a C++ library shipped with all standards-compliant compilers. It's designed to make programming a lot easier for us developers by providing
            efficient and/or elegant implementations for common tasks.</p>

          
<p>To see what the code looks like after preprocessing, you can run the command:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_r0oNPV8dR0" lang="none">g++ -E hello.cc</div>

          
<p>The
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_YNRab8l50m">&#8211;E</span>
            compiler flag tells it to stop compiling and spit out the result of the preprocessor to the console. But brace yourself, because iostream is a pretty large file. iostream also
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_hvOoZzsNda">#include</span>s other files. On my laptop, the result of the preprocessor is 39074 lines long!</p>

          
<p>Thankfully, you don't have to understand its contents. I don't understand it, either. What iostream does, however, is define (among other things) an object called
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_ZU3hbLjMEj">std::cout</span>. This object can be given things to write to the console.</p>

          
<p>In the naming hierarchy, where does this object live, you might ask? Well, it lives in the namespace, or group of names, "std" (for standard, not for...) and is called cout. I like to think of namespaces as folders. If you keep things in folders
            all nicely organized, it's harder to accidentally reference a file with the same name, but in different locations. In the same way we keep our variables and functions in namespaces so they don't get mixed up.</p>

          
<p>The third line defines a function. This function, like any other function in C++ and other strongly typed languages like Java or C, has a return type, specifying what type of value it is returning. In this case, the return type is "int." An int is
            a representation of an integer. The function's name is "main," and it takes no arguments. The body of the function is enclosed in curly braces.</p>

          
<p>"main" is no ordinary function. Whatever is in it will be what is actually run when you execute a program. This is very similar to main in a Java class (or Main in C#), as well as main in C and
            <span class=" python inline-code" id="f_xA0fgY4cXe">if __name__ == "__main__"</span>
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do" target="_blank">in Python</a>. If we called our function "main1" instead, nothing will actually be run.</p>

          
<p>At the end of third line is a comment. Like Java, C#, and JS a line comment in C++ begins with two forward slashes and ends at the end of the line. Note that forward slashes in strings do not start comments.</p>

          
<p>We can also write block comments. A block comment is a comment that can span one or multiple lines, starting at /* and ending at */, just like Java, C#, and JS. Note that these block comments do not nest! They can be put anywhere you'd like,
            including in the middle of statements (but I don't recommend it).</p>

<p>The fourth line is probably the strangest line of the program to foreigners. What
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_wvmHxXLUuI">&lt;&lt;</span>
            is doing is streaming the string "Hello, World\n" to
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_xm018TDrjF">std::cout</span>. I think of it like you are pouring out the string. This syntax contrasts with a lot of other languages' console output methods, such as Java's
            <span class=" java inline-code" id="f_4yrLYJ5Rbc">System.out.println</span>, Python's
            <span class=" python inline-code" id="f_bhoqF13Mtt">print</span>, C's
            <span class=" c inline-code" id="f_TLJDHxpOvV">printf</span>
            and JS's
            <span class=" javascript inline-code" id="f_Hsi7jfu9nt">console.log</span>, all of which are framed as a function.</p>

          
<p>To be more precise,
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_WuZ7fkvGc7">&lt;&lt;</span>
            is a binary operator (an operator taking two arguments), which passes the string to
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_a0BBgstkqU">std::cout</span>
            for
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_XcDuFujLyE">std::cout</span>
            to handle. Furthermore, this operator returns
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_jf7B3R5r2T">std::cout</span>
            again, and since operators are evaluated from left to right, we can do something like:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_x0fbYr8Ejw">
            
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "Merry " &lt;&lt; "Christmas " &lt;&lt; "to " &lt;&lt; "you!\n"; <br />
} <br />


          </div>

          
<p>and it will write out "Merry Christmas to you!", because it is evaluated as</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_fmpy6fMbU5">
            
(((std::cout &lt;&lt; "Merry ") &lt;&lt; "Christmas ") &lt;&lt; "to ") &lt;&lt; "you!\n"; <br />


          </div>

          
<p>The fourth line ends in a semicolon. Just like C, Java, C# and JS, a semicolon is the only statement separator in C++. (Somewhat little known fact: a semicolon is also a valid statement separator in Python.)</p>

          
<p>You might notice that the function main has no return statement. Normally, if main returns 0, it signifies the program ran without errors; another value (often -1) signifies an error occurred. The C++ standard declares that if the end of main is
            reached, the function implicitly returns 0. Convenient!</p>

          
<p>Well now that we understand (hopefully) what the code does, how does the computer?</p>
        
</div>

<h3 id='v' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.1.2: The Compiler</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>The workings of a compiler are wonderful but mysterious. Personally, I have no clue how they work, so I treat them as sort of a black box. I feed my laboriously written source code into and blithely watch as worthless assembly comes out ("garbage
            in, garbage out").</p>

          
<p>Jokes aside, a compiler is the heart and soul of a C++ environment. Without it, the computer has no idea what you want it to do. Fundamentally, the compiler, given source code, converts the code to assembly. Assembly is not exactly a single
            language, but rather a class of language that maps extremely closely to what the computer's CPU can do. If you want to see the assembly output of a C++ program, compile like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_vU2Xrnyrww" lang="none">g++ -S hello.cc</div>

          
<p>This will write the assembly output of the compiler to a file called
            <code lang="none">hello.s</code>.</p>

          
<p>The file's content looks really complicated, but every operation is extremely simple. Move this chunk of memory here, do this operation here; it's very basic, so basic that a programmer cannot really represent high-level concepts in it. It makes
            me slightly sick to think that people used to have to write large programs in this. Thankfully, most people don't have to experience writing assembly anymore.</p>

          
<p>We're not done yet, though, but we're close. The computer must convert the assembly into machine code. Machine code simply consists of a long hexadecimal sequence telling the
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_HfgRq0TW5z" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="Central processing unit, a part of a computer that processes data, and typically consisting of a small number of powerful threads which operate independently.&#10;">CPU</a>
            exactly what to do and is completely unreadable to the common human. The conversion from assembly to machine code is not done by the compiler itself, but by a vendor-provided
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_0L8hZK9Pfx" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A program which converts assembly code to machine code.&#10;">assembler</a>.</p>

          
<p>Thankfully, we don't need to handle the assembly intermediate step. Without
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_qxW0f9w4Vl">&#8211;S</span>, the compiler will just output machine code that we can use immediately.</p>

          
<p>Well that was long. I sincerely hope you haven't seen a hello world example/explanation that long before. Perhaps it was excessive, but I wanted to show you exactly what is going on so you don't get confused later when I talk about compiling, and
            also get you to appreciate how much fluff languages like Python abstract away for you. I won't even go close to this much into detail in the future, but a lot of people seem to get confused about the role of a compiler and how to even compile and
            execute a C++ file, so I thought this would be helpful for uninformed individuals. I'm sure some or maybe even most of it was redundant information to you.</p>

          
<p>If you want to play around with this example, you can download it
            <a download="" href="examples/example1.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. To compile
            <code lang="none">hello.cc</code>, just run
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_JoZJmvKpc6">make</span>. To output assembly to
            <code lang="none">hello.s</code>, run
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_cuwpsyG14W">make asm</span>. Finally, to print out preprocessor output, do
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_9nyUYnG7TZ">make pre</span>. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id='w' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.1.3: Summary</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>We've just looked at a very basic program. You've learned the role of the function main (the function that&#8217;s actually run) as well as learned what printing looks like.</p>

          
<p>C++ is a compiled language. Thus, its source code is turned into machine code by a
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_sgqR6m9oFF" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A software that converts code in a high level language, like C++, to low level code that can be run by the computer directly.&#10;">compiler</a>
            and
            <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_QPjcSW12kv" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="A program which converts assembly code to machine code.&#10;">assembler</a>. To compile your program, run in a shell:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_v9OCivb9Mc" lang="none">g++ -o &lt;machine code output file name&gt; &lt;path to source&gt;</div>

          
<p>For example, to compile
            <code lang="none">udder.cc</code>
            to
            <code lang="none">milk</code>, we do:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_o7YYY1fZFN" lang="none">g++ -o milk udder.cc</div>

          
<p>As an aside, I suggest you compile to
            <code lang="none">milk.exe</code>
            on Windows.</p>

          
<p>We can run
            <code lang="none">milk</code>/<code lang="none">milk.exe</code>
            in the command line by doing
            <span class=" nohighlight inline-code" id="f_M0a3ywarSg">./milk</span>. We can also open it as you would normally open a file in the system file viewer (Explorer, Finder, etc.), which should open up a command line interface and run the program immediately.</p>

<div class="content">

</div><h3 id='y' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.2.0: Statements</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>As a C-family language, C++'s statement separator is the semicolon. Multiple statements can appear on the same line like so. Semicolons are not optional.</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_pKBQDR0K4o">
            
&lt;statement_1&gt;; <br />

&lt;statement_2&gt;;            	// Misinterpretation by compiler, likely error <br />


          </div>

          
<p>Statements can be split over multiple lines, though, if the newline can be interpreted as plain whitespace. For example,</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_SD1AZiTRdh">
            
int main() <br />
{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int <br />

} <br />


          </div>

          
<p>compiles fine, but</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_E9LgosWQYM">
            
int main() <br />
{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5; <br />
} <br />


          </div>

          
<p>does not.</p>

        
</div>

<h3 id='z' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.2.1: Variable Initialization</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>C++ is strongly typed. That is, every function has a specific type it returns, and every variable has a specific type. Initializing and setting a variable is done like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_WQlKqg9iYw">
            
&lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;; <br />


          </div>

          
<p>or, since C++11, using the uniform initialization syntax, like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_Zzwre01h3A">
            
&lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;{&lt;value&gt;}; <br />


          </div>

          
<p>For example, initializing an
            <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_MwUth1jwQq">int a</span>
            to 5 can be done like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_hEFyhyigri">
            
int a = 5; <br />
int a{5};  // Or this <br />


          </div>

          
<p>Which you choose is mostly a personal preference. I will use the first syntax because it will probably be more familiar to you. We can initialize multiple variables of the same type like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_BO0MnZI3j4">
            
&lt;type&gt; &lt;name_1&gt;, &lt;name_2&gt;, ... ; <br />
int a = 0, b = 5; <br />
int a{0}, b{5}; <br />


          </div>

          
<p>You can allocate variables without setting their value like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_LCfjee1b1J">
            
int a; <br />
int a, b; <br />


          </div>

          
<p>but this can be dangerous because accessing their values can return junk values. It might also trigger certain compiler warnings. As a rule of thumb, I suggest you set all variables when you initialize them, unless you are in an extremely tight
            performance area. Even then it is a miniscule benefit at best.</p>

          
<p>Variable names are allowed to contain alphanumeric characters, _ (underscore), and $ (dollar sign). They may not start with a number. Names are case-sensitive, so UdDeR is a different variable from udder.</p>

          
<p>At any point in code we can reassign a variable, like so:</p>

          
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_SjV9ANejLh">
            
int a = 5; <br />
std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; " udders\n"; // prints 5 udders <br />
a = 3; // a is now 3 <br />


          </div>
        
</div>

<h3 id='aa' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.2.2: Functions</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>The syntax for a function is like so:</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_dx4IpAQnsO">
          
&lt;return_type&gt; &lt;function_name&gt;(&lt;arguments&gt;) { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;function_body&gt; <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>The rules for function naming and variable naming are the same. For example, suppose we want to implement a function called "square" which squares a given <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_yPeWGYrs1M">int</span> and returns an <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_hfeRPBBssc">int</span>. We could do that like so:</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_vK1vmirLsz">
          
int square(int a) { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a_squared = a * a; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a_squared; <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>More succinctly, we could write it like so:</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_oUdoKq75vk">
          
int square(int a) { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a * a; <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>Let's try it out!</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_QJB6pYJecY">
          
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
 <br />
int square(int a) { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a * a; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int raise_to_8th(int a) { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return square(square(square(a))); <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "5^2 = " &lt;&lt; square(5) &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "5^4 = " &lt;&lt; square(square(5)) &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "13^8 = " &lt;&lt; raise_to_8th(13) &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>This program simply calculates 52, 54, and 138.</p>

        
<p>If a function returns nothing, the "return type" is called <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_FyCuuPy4n1">void</span>. For example:</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_jNoP53qOmq">
          
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
 <br />
void writeMilk() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "milk"; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writeMilk(); <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writeMilk(); <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writeMilk(); <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>will cause an error. Thus,</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_oNG7FM8Ghw">
          
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void c; <br />
} <br />


        </div>

        
<p>will print "milkmilkmilk" to the console. <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_DxkQA4GsB6">void</span> is not a normal type, so doing something like</p>

        
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_d7q1y8eeht">
          int milky = writeMilk();
        </div>

        
<p>won&#8217;t compile.</p>

      
</div>

<h3 id='ab' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.2.3: Scope</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Various constructs, such as loops (which we&#8217;ll learn the syntax for later) and functions, create what is known as a scope. Basically, new scopes are made by any pair of curly braces containing statements. Things inside of a scope cannot leak out of a scope and used by surrounding code unless explicitly done so. Things in &#8220;shallower&#8221; parent scopes, including the global scope, however, can be used in a scope. For example:</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_K4DlGOiZjZ">
  
void derp() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c *= 4; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 5; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derp(); <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>doesn&#8217;t compile. This does, however:</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_ey51OWSljW">
  
int c = 5; <br />
 <br />
void derp() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c *= 4; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derp(); <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>Note that the initialization of c needs to be before the function derp.</p>


<p>In a scope, we initialize a variable with the same name as another variable in another scope, and any references to that variable name will resolve to the variable we just declared. For example,</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_trsGrqQhDl">
  
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 5; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ // Creates a scope <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 3; // Different variable from the first <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c = 4;    // Modifies the second c <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; std::endl; // References first c <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>will output 5, but</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_l4RpnN8rnT">
  
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 5; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c = 4; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; std::endl; <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>outputs 4.</p>


<p>When writing code, we typically give each deeper scope a deeper indentation level. Unlike in Python, which uses these indents in lieu of the curly braces, the compiler does not care about your indents, only your human readers.</p>


<p>This scope concept should hopefully be familiar to you, as it is is present in most languages.</p>


</div>

<h3 id='ac' style="padding-top: 80px; margin-top: -80px;">2.2.4: One Definition Rule</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>You cannot redefine a function with the same name or redefine a variable with the same name in the same scope. For example:</p>

  
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_uALZK00z20">
    
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
 <br />
int f(int a, int b) { // fine <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a * b; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int f(int c, int d) { // error <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return c + d; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int f(int a) { // fine <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a * a; <br />
} <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 5; // fine <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 9; // error <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c = 9; // fine <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = 9; // fine <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br />
} <br />


  </div>

  
<p>As you might find out the hard way later, this also applies if the source of whatever header file you <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_7LimSBvTv8">#include</span> redefines this function. The solution to this is namespaces, which we'll talk about later.</p>

  
<p>C++'s operators are relatively standard in terms of their mathematical manipulation capabilities. For now you only need to concern yourself with multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division.</p>

  
<p>Like in most other C-family languages an expression is evaluated according to <a arrow="true" delay="200" href="javascript:void(0);" id="f_GSz4FS2lkS" maxwidth="180px" placement="bottom" title="Abbreviation for an order of operations: parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication and division (left to right), addition and subtraction (left to right).&#10;">PEMDAS</a> (or, since C++ doesn&#8217;t have an exponential operator, PMDAS). For example,</p>

  
<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_7rRtqyw8RZ">
    
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a = 4; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int b = 8; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int c = (a * b + b / a &#8211; b) * b; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; "c = " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
} <br />


  </div>


<p>is evaluated like <span class="cpp inline-code" id="f_FkwqcE8Rl4">c = (((4 * 8) + (8 / 4)) &#8211; 8) * 8</span>, resulting in 208.</p>


<p>There are quite a few more operators than these four. Four related operators that are probably familiar to you are +=, -=, *=, and /=. These operators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide, respectively, a variable in place. For example:</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_lcon9sTPe5">
  
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a = -5; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a *= 2; // a is now -10 <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int b = 7; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a += 7; // a is now -3 <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b = 5; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a -= b; // a is now -8 <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a /= -4; // a is now 2 <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "\n"; <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>There are two other operators to remember: increment and decrement operators. They are a bit strange to the uninformed, but here is a brief rundown:</p>


<ol type="1">
<li>To increment a variable x, or add 1 to it, we write ++x; or x++;</li>
<li>The return value of ++x; is x after it is incremented, this is called preincrement</li>
<li>The return value of x++; is x before it is incremented, this is called postincrement</li>
<li>The same applies to decrements, where the syntax is --x; or x--;</li>
</ol>


<p>A simple demonstration I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1094872/is-there-a-difference-between-x-and-x-in-java" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>


<div class="code-cf cpp" id="f_hXUzquAdRK">
  
#include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
 <br />
int main() { <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x = 5; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int y = 5; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; ++x &lt;&lt; ", "; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ", "; <br />
 <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; y++ &lt;&lt; ", "; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std::cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; ", "; <br />
} <br />


</div>


<p>This program outputs:</p>


<div class="code-cf nohighlight" id="f_58Zdj0S0lH" lang="none">6, 6, 5, 6</div>


<p>Note that there are a lot of other ways to write the code in this section from a syntactic point of view, but do exactly the same thing from a processor's point of view. These will be explored in time, but to reduce complexity, I just wanted to mention the most basic syntax, and only use this basic syntax in examples.</p>


<p>Please play around with these concepts yourself! They are incredibly important.</p>


<p>Now that you understand basic syntax, let's learn about the fundamental types!</p>
