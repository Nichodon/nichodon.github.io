      <title>Are you Ready?</title>

      <content>
        <p>tl; dr: I expect you to have programmed before in another, imperative (i.e. not functional) language. I also expect you to know the very basics of the command line (how to open it on your computer, and the cd command). Finally, I expect you to
          understand binary and hexadecimal notation: though you don't have to be able to read it quickly!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I am not good at explaining the basic ideas of programming to people. This document is written on the assumption that you have had significant experience programming in another language, preferably object-oriented (OO) and
          imperative: either a primarily scripting language like JS or Python, or a more heavyweight language like Java or C#. Though syntax and differences to other languages will be explained to the best of my ability, things like for-loops, while loops,
          functions, etc. which are ubiquitous in almost all such programming languages will not be explained beyond features and characteristics specific to C++.</p>

        <p>When discussing first languages with people who haven’t programmed before, I typically recommend a language like Python or Ruby: high-level languages that are not so “close to the metal,” but close to the way us humans think. With a little
          explanation, even a non-programmer can, perhaps with some difficulty, read basic Python code. I find that C++, on the other hand, is one of those languages whose syntax takes more getting used to.</p>

        <p>Experience solely in languages that are not imperative – like Scheme, which unfortunately seems to be the most popular language in high-school classes – most likely will not be helpful. I’m known to have quite the bias against Scheme in
          particular, so don’t take my complaints about it seriously, but functional programming requires such a different thinking paradigm than imperative programming that you might find some very standard implementation in imperative languages unnatural.
          This is not to degrade the importance and beauty of functional programming, but to point out that it is very different.</p>

        <p>If, before starting off on learning C++, you believe that all you need to learn is the syntax, I suggest you wait and gather more experience. A language may have certain syntax or “looks,” but syntax is only a part of what makes a language useful,
          elegant, or appropriate for a task. Programming in C++ is very different from programming in other object-oriented languages like Java, or even deeply related languages like C. A language comes shipped not just with a different appearance, but with
          different conventions, structure, and thinking paradigm.</p>

        <p>As to more specific requirements, I expect you to know how to navigate folders using the command line on your system (i.e. knowing cd), as well as understand binary. Both of these are relatively easy to pick up.</p>

      <title>Do You Need This?</title>

      <content>
        <p>tl; dr: If you're already comfortable with all commonly-used features of C++, this is not for you, though you may find some parts of it entertaining.</p>

        <p>I’m not a professional developer by any means, just another nerdy teenager interested in programming and how computers work. I’m not trained as a teacher, either.</p>

        <p>So why am I writing this, you might ask? There is no lack of quality textbooks for C++, after all. Well, looking at online tutorials for C++, I find a few issues that really impede an interested programmer from learning the language for use. The
          vast majority of online tutorials teach C++ as either

          <list enumerate="number">
            <item>A small, perhaps even only syntactic extension of C</item>
            <item>A purely object-oriented language like Java, where almost every concept is represented as an object</item>
          </list>

        </p>

        <p>I think the problem with teaching these two ways of thought is not that their style is necessarily factually incorrect, per se, but that they are not taking full advantage of C++. As far as languages go, C++ is enormously complex and powerful, but
          with that complexity and power comes the power to mess up in unobvious ways. This, combined with the fact that most of these tutorials attempt to teach from the most basic grounds of programming up, makes fully teaching the language difficult. Once
          you have learned it, however, you can see the beauties of its design.</p>

        <p>I don’t know and do not profess to know all of C++’s features; this takes many years of learning and usage. I do profess, however, the understanding of how it works and how to write mediocre-quality code in it. I write this now rather than later
          because this gives me a unique perspective on the language: unlike a newbie, I’m not completely clueless, but unlike a seasoned developer, I do not explain concepts to a beginner in a way that takes an unnecessarily high-level view of a subject.
          Unfortunately, this means that this document will not be comprehensive in covering every feature of the language.</p>

        <p>If you already are an experienced C++ programmer comfortable with types and templates and throw and such things, this is not for you. In fact, you’re probably already a better programmer than I am.</p>

      <title>Are You Interested?</title>
      <content>
        <p>tl; dr: C++ was designed for high-performance situations and large codebases, not for quick and dirty scripts. If you are interested in writing highly performant programs, you might enjoy learning C++.</p>

        <p>Assuming you didn’t skip here, the fact that you read this far seems to me that you might be interested. C++ is an amazingly powerful language, an elegant combination of both low-level performance and high-level abstraction, but it takes a while
          to get used to.</p>

        <p>It is no secret that developing good code in C++ takes more time than developing in related languages. This is because there is a lot less fluff separating you, the programmer, from the machine, your computer’s processor(s). C++ particularly
          excels in situations where you</p>

        <list enumerate="lowercase">
          <item>want to maximize performance</item>
          <item>are working with small amounts of processing power and/or RAM</item>
          <item>work with large amounts of data</item>
        </list>

        <p>among others. If you’re just writing quick and dirty scripts to process text or something, then C++ probably isn’t for you; some people just find C++ too complex a language for their little code snippets. In large codebases or programs that need
          good performance, however, C++ can work wonders.</p>

        <p>If C++ is too complicated for you to grasp now and you’d like to try a language with similar performance benefits, you can try C, which is by and large a subset of C++, or try newer OO languages inspired by C++ like D (such a creative name) or
          Rust. C, of course, is extremely popular, but not always as scalable as C++. I know nothing about D, but it doesn’t seem that popular, probably for reasons of C++'s historicity. Though I've personally never really looked into it (and I probably
          should), from what I've seen Rust seems quite a wonderful language with performance benefits comparable to C++. It is relatively new and not yet that mature, but perhaps in the future we’ll see entire operating systems being written in Rust!</p>

        <p>If you’re still excited to learn C++, let’s dive in!</p>
