	A Mole. A furry-subterranean creature and a most important constant. Let's straighten this out: a mole is \(6.022*10^{23}\), or in laymen’s terms \(602200000000000000000000\). Wow! What an amazingly long number, but what’s its significance? Take a atom &ndash; for simplicity, a HYDROGEN atom. Now that’s great, but how many atoms do you need to fill up one blimp? That’s where Avogadro's number, also known as MOLE comes into play. You may be wondering why such a random number holds such importance. Let’s go back to our blimp conundrum. If you have a MOLE of those pesky little atoms, their weight equals EXACTLY one gram. You may be wondering why this is. There are a certain number of neutrons in a gram exactly one mole, in fact. Is this number’s significance dawning upon you yet? As a proton and an electron combined weigh exactly similar amounts to a neutron, and most atoms are deionized, MOLES can be used to calculate some very useful information about molecules.

<p>
	<strong>FOR INSTANCE</strong>
	You have probably all seen a stereotypical chemical reaction, say, methane combustion. \(\text{CH}_4+2\text{O}_2\to\text{CO}_2+2\text{H}_2\text{O}\)
</p>

<p>
	For some reason, you use methane as fuel and you MUST for an extravagantly noble project calculate your carbon footprint weight. In this example you have 48 grams of <i>mathane</i> (methane spelled much better). You can’t figure out your carbon footprint without using moles! 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>OBSERVE</strong>
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Find methane’s weight in grams per mole by adding up it’s nucleic parts (atomic weight / isotope 
	number)<br>In this instance it’s 1 carbon-12 plus 4 hydrogen, 1 each (so 16)</li>

	<li>Divide 48 by 16 to acquire your number of methane moles (3)</li>

	<li>Multiply 3 by Avogadro's constant, I leave it in multiplied form for reasons made clear farther 
	on(\(3*6.022*10^{23}\))This is your number of methane molecules</li>

	<li>That equation above states that for every molecule of methane, a molecule of \(\text{CO}_2\) is 
	produced. You can divide that number by avogadro's constant to find your number
	of moles of \(\text{CO}_2\), which is 3!</li>

	<li>Find carbon dioxide’s atomic weight just like in step 1! 12 + 16 + 16 = 44</li>

	<li>Multiply 3 by 44 to find out that for every 48 grams of methane you burn you produce 132 
grams of carbon dioxide!</li>
</ol>

<p>
	In general, once you have a chemical reaction with a balanced equation, you yourself can do what I did here! Do this by following this handy formula

	$$\frac{\text{amount of reactant} * \text{atomic weight of reactant} * \text{amount of reactant in equation}}{\text{amount of product in reaction} * \text{atomic weight of product}} = \text{weight of product (grams)}$$

	But moles can be more interesting then this…
</p>

<p>
	Back to our blimp problem: If that enormous mass of metal is at STP, any gas in it will be at a density of 22.4 liters for a mole! This is great! We know that this blimp’s interior is 22400 cubic meters. Every cubic meter is 1000 liters. That's 22400000 entire liters! Using our formula, we can figure out that there are 1000000 moles, or \(602200000000000000000000000000\) molecules. An interesting thing about gas is that it will always have similar amounts of molecules at a certain density, no matter type. Temperature will mix things up a little, but that's a story for another time. Speaking of time, did you notice that this is the only time I said THAT word? Yes. I’m talking about <strong>T-H-E</strong>, also known as english’s most used word. If you noticed that so far, you’re a truly amazing person.
