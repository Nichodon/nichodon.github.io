# Moomath Repo

## About

Hello, we are anematode and Nichodon, and this is our project Moomath! We're two high school freshmen who share a love of programming, music, math, cows, and anything else nerdy. Moomath, our lovely math blog, is where we post our random mathy thoughts and weird JS programs. We posts things that are unually in-depth or functional. Here's a table of some of our best content:

| Content | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| [Base-Motif Fractals](https://moomath.com/articles/0003/) | Geometry |
| [Time Signature Metronome](https://moomath.com/programs/0003/) | Music |
| [Solar System Simulator](https://moomath.com/programs/0006/) | Science |
| [Brainf\*ck Interpreter](https://moomath.com/programs/0007/) | Programs |
