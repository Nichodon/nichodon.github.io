## Contributing

Though we'd love to have direct contributions, you don't have to be an excellent programmer to contribute, either! Novel ideas are appreciated, as well as bug fixes and/or code quality improvements. If you'd actually like to write or fix some code, please fork this the repository and make a pull request. This is a rather small project as of now, so we don't have any particular standards on how to contribute.

If you've found an issue with something, please notify us! Assuming you have a GitHub account, you can add one on our [Issues](https://github.com/Nichodon/nichodon.github.io/issues) page. If not, just shoot Timothy an email â€“ contact information is above. Critical security issues, however, should probably not be reported on the GitHub Issues page, as it is public. If you have found a dangerous flaw (e.g. allowing running of shell commands on the server computer) please email Timothy.
