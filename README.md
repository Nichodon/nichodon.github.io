# Moomath

### (previously Visual Math, also known as nichodon.github.io)

Welcome to the repository for [Moomath](moomath.com).

We're two high school freshmen who share a love of programming, music, math, and, well, anything good!
We like putting various content on here, but it's not exactly that user-friendly, both for website visitors and potential contributors. That's something, however, to be improved on.

Here's a table of some of our best content, with a lovely representative from each category.

| Content | Link | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base-Motif Fractals | [Link](https://nichodon.github.io/fractals/0003/) | Math |
| Time Signature Metronome | [Link](https://nichodon.github.io/programs/0003/) | Music |
| Solar System Simulator | [Link](https://nichodon.github.io/programs/0006/) | Science |
| Brainf*ck Interpreter (WIP) | [Link](https://nichodon.github.io/programs/0008/) | Programming |
