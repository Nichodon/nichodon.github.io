				<p>Good <span></span>! I'm an incoming high school freshman (as of 10:53 28 June, 2017 CE) in Palo Alto, CA. I also have many great accomplishments. Like, once I sort of did some math thing and it was fun. I greatly enjoy composing music, programming, web design, and of course, bovine things.</p>

				<h1>Contributing</h1>
				<p>Though we'd love to have direct contributions, you don't have to be an excellent programmer to contribute, either. Novel ideas are appreciated, as well as bug fixes and/or code quality improvements. If you'd actually like to write or fix some code, please fork this the repository and make a pull request. This is a rather small project as of now, so we don't have any particular standards on how to contribute.</p>
				<p>If you've found an issue with something, please notify us. Assuming you have a GitHub account, you can add one on our <a href="https://github.com/Nichodon/nichodon.github.io/issues" target="_blank">Issues</a> page. If not, just shoot Timothy an email â€“ contact information is above. Critical security issues, however, should probably not be reported on the GitHub Issues page, as it is public. If you have found a dangerous flaw (e.g. allowing running of shell commands on the server computer) please email Timothy.</p>
