<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>
  To select a body, click on it. Scroll to zoom in or out on the body, and click and drag to shift the view.<br>
  To make selecting a body and viewing a body's position easier, the bodies' sizes have been exaggerated which can be controlled with the "Planetary Size" slider.
</p>

<h2>Bodies</h2>

<p>
  Currently, the bodies we use are the objects in the Solar System above 450 kilometres and that have been imaged with high detail.<br>
  The bodies exaggerated are the ones orbiting around the sun (above 450 km).<br><br>
  <strong>Note</strong>: we have tried not to engage in any copyright infrigement. However, if you own one of the textures used, please contact us and we will remove it as soon as possible.<br>
  We omit textures that have missing portions generally more than 50% (sorry Charon).<br>
  Also, we try to use accurate maps that are as close to true color as possible.<br>
  The general consensus on the Internet is that Eris is a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=eris+texture+map" target="_blank">purple Ganymede</a>, which is why we don't have it yet.
