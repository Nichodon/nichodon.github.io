			<p>Ever since the term was introduced by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, "fractals" have awed so many people with their odd combination of simplicity and complexity. In this article I specifically talk about fractals in the complex plane, but fractal geometry and its derivatives are a fascinating part of math going much beyond what I detail here, so definitely get yourself interested in that.</p>
