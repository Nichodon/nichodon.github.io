			<h1>Fractals in the Complex Plane</h1>
			<p>Ever since the term was introduced by Benoit B. Mandelbrot, "fractals" have awed so many people with their odd combination of simplicity and complexity. In this article I specifically talk about fractals in the complex plane, but fractal geometry and its derivatives are a fascinating part of math going much beyond what I detail here, so definitely get yourself interested in that.</p>
			<p>Before we begin, let's figure out exactly what a <strong>fractal</strong> is. Dictionary.com defines the word fractal to mean "<em>a geometrical or physical structure having an irregular or fragmented shape at all scales of measurement between a greatest and smallest scale such that certain mathematical or</em>&hellip;</p>
